#Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## 📊 A Data Science Minor Project using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

This project presents an exploratory analysis of a real-world airline passenger satisfaction dataset sourced from [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=9&pageSize=5). It was developed as part of the **Data Science Minor Project** under the guidance of **Dr. Mrinalini Rana**, HOD, Data Science, at **Lovely Professional University**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze passenger satisfaction based on travel class, age group, and flight distance  
- Identify high-impact services influencing overall satisfaction  
- Detect consistently low-rated services needing improvement  
- Understand how delays affect passenger sentiment  
- Segment passengers demographically for targeted insights

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **EDA with Pandas and NumPy**
- **Custom metric:** Total Service Score (aggregating 14 service ratings)
- **Age Group & Distance Group segmentation**
- **Visualizations:** Heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, and correlation matrices
- **Clear analysis structure** with 5 targeted objectives
